            <p>Roses are red,
                Violets are blue,
                This long-distance struggle,
                Ain't got nothing on me and you!
                Every mile between us just proves one thing‚Äîour love is like WiFi with the strongest signal, unbreakable, even
                across continents. Sure, buffering sucks, and time zones are rude, but no lag can slow down the download speed
                of my love for you!
                I love you a lotttttttts (like a ridiculous amount), and nothing‚Äînot distance, not waiting, not even bad
                internet‚Äîcan change that. Soon, this ‚Äúlong-distance‚Äù part of our love story will be history, and I'll finally
                get to annoy you in person every single day.
                Happy Valentine's Day, my love! üíï Can't wait to be in your arms forever! üòò</p>
            <div class="extra">
                <p>My love, through every mile and every moment apart, my heart only beats stronger for you. Allah has written our love in the most beautiful way, and with patience and trust in Allah's plan, we will soon be together, insha'Allah. Just as Allah says, ‚ÄúIndeed, with hardship comes ease‚Äù, I know that every struggle we face only strengthens our bond.
                    I pray that Allah blesses our marriage with endless love, mercy, and tranquility, and that Allah reunites us soon in the best of ways. No matter the distance, my love for you knows no bounds. You are my greatest blessing, my heart, and my forever.
                    May Allah always keep us together and make our love a source of barakah in this life and the next.
                    Ameen.</p>
